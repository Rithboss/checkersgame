 2: Offers flexibility with different model types and portfolio optimization options.
 3: Includes functionality for generating performance reports and analyzing factor contributions.

# Cons:
 1: Relies heavily on external libraries, potentially introducing dependency issues.
 2: Documentation could be improved for better clarity and user guidance.
 3: Certain features, like train_freq parameter, are not yet fully implemented.


Here's an evaluation of the codebase based on the criteria you provided, with scores from 1 (poor) to 10 (excellent)

* Functionality (7/10): The codebase provides a comprehensive set of tools for factor analysis and WFO, including data cleaning, factor creation, model training, and performance evaluation. It supports various model types and portfolio optimization techniques, offering flexibility for different investment strategies.
* Correctness (6/10): While the code appears to be generally functional, the presence of warnings and TODO comments suggests potential areas for improvement and bug fixes. Further testing and validation would be needed to ensure correctness.
* Code Quality (8/10): The code is well-structured and modular, with clear separation of concerns between different classes and functions. The use of type hints and docstrings enhances readability and understanding.
* Performance (6/10): The code utilizes parallel processing and optimization techniques, but the efficiency could vary depending on the size of the data and the chosen model. Profiling and optimization might be necessary for larger datasets or computationally intensive models. 
* Maintainability (7/10):  The modular design and use of object-oriented principles contribute to maintainability. However, the dependency on external libraries and the potential for future changes in those libraries could pose challenges.
* Usability (6/10):  The codebase provides a framework for quantitative analysis, but it may require some familiarity with factor investing and machine learning concepts. Improved documentation and examples would enhance usability for a wider range of users.
